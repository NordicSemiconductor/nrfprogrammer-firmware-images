  "description": "This Matter weather station application demonstrates the usage of the Matter application layer to build a weather station device. Such a device lets you remotely gather different kinds of data using the device sensors, such as temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. The device works as a Matter accessory device, meaning it can be paired and controlled remotely over a Matter network built on top of Wi-Fi network.\n\nThis application requires nRF7002 Expansion Board.",
